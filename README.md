# Python Practice Course

Welcome to the **Python Practice Course** repository! This repo is designed to help learners practice and master Python through a variety of practical coding exercises, examples, and mini-projects.

## üìö Course Overview

This repository contains Python scripts covering a wide range of foundational topics and practical applications, including:
- Data types, variables, and operators
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions, recursion, and lambda expressions
- Exception handling and error management
- File I/O
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command-line arguments and user input
- Mini-projects and games

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up on Python concepts, you'll find useful examples and practice files here.

Some key files and what they cover:
- **data_type.py, numeric_datatype.py, boolean_data_type.py, tuple.py, sets.py, lists.py, dictionaries.py**: Practice with Python's built-in data types.
- **functions.py, recursion.py, lambda.py, closure.py, scope.py**: Function definitions, recursion, lambda expressions, closures, and scope.
- **loops.py, control flow**: For and while loops, conditional statements.
- **exception_error_try_.py**: Error handling and exceptions.
- **files.py, user_input.py, command_line_agrs.py**: File operations, getting user input, and command-line arguments.
- **classes_objects.py, oop_bank_acc.py, BankAccount.py**: Object-oriented programming, classes, and a bank account example.
- **play_game_archade.py, rps_game.py, rps_command_line_version.py, guess_number_game.py**: Simple games for hands-on coding fun.
- **modules.py, pip_venv.py, requirements.txt**: Using Python modules, virtual environments, and managing dependencies.
- **climate.py**: Example involving climate data (details in file).
- **Python_Prep.py**: General preparation and practice exercises.

All files are standalone and can be run individually.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
